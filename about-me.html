            <p>I am an aspiring entrepreneur and a programmer. But just being tech savvy doesn't help me
              weave such stories (though it helped me to develop this website instead of creating from a template in w3schools.com or even wix.com where you don't need to write a single line of code!).
             I am currently studying highschool and this life helped me weave the emotion embedded lines
              along with a good inventory of novels in my brain.
              My love for the personality of Mark Zuckerberg played by XYZ in the movie "the social network" inspired me a lot. As a result, Zillion.com was born.
              I've hosted this in Github thus drastically reducing the chances of being indexed in Google. I personally don't prefer this website to be read by the public. So you, the one currently reading this lines
              should either by in my friends' circle or in my friends' friend. 
              Hope you had 'emotions' reading my stories!
