    <i>A letter from the author.......</i> <br><br>
    Wilkommen guys and this quote is one of my favourite motivational quotes.
    Motivation is something that can be described as a push, a reviver, a redeemer.
    It can be of many forms but most often, people search for "motivational videos".
    Well...I'm not opposed to that but I support the fact that motivation can be highly inspiring and be remembered if it is in the form of a story.
    I hope you guys find your motivating push in the stories that are a scroll away from you. Happy reading!
    <br>
    Signing off,
    <br>
    Thilak,

    Father of Zillion
    <br>
    P.S: I'll meet you after your journey.
